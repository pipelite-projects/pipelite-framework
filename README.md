# Pipelite Framework

This is the home of the Pipelite Framework.
Pipelite is a Java framework that, through the use of the Enterprise Integration Patterns, simplifies and speeds up the development of message driven asynchronous applications.
It supports the interaction with the external systems by the declarative use of the adapters that provide an high level of abstraction for the third party technologies.
