# Pipelite Framework

This is the home of the Pipelite Framework.

Pipelite is a Java&trade; framework that, through the use of the _[Enterprise Integration Patterns](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com)_, simplifies and speeds up the development of message driven asynchronous applications.

It supports the interaction with the external systems by the declarative use of the _channel-adapters_ that provide an high level of abstraction for the third party technologies.
